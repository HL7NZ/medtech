This means that if\nthere is data about a single patient in different PMS's tthen a call will be required to each one to retrieve all\nthe data. It is the responsibility of the client to perform any aggregation and de-duplication.\n\nRefer to the spec for details on the [API](http://hl7.org/fhir/http.html) and \n[search](http://hl7.org/fhir/search.html), though note that this API supports only a subset of the defined queries.\n",
