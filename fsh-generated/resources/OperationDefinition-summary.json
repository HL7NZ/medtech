  "description": "The summary operation asks the server to return the latest appropriate summary for the patient. \nThe patient is either\n\n* explicitly identified by the id of the patient resource\n* implicitly identified as the only patient in scope due to security/context\n* specified by other additional (unspecified here) parameters (or do we specify the identifier parameter?)\n\nThis operation returns a bundle (type = document) for single patient.\n\nThe operation asks for the latest appropriate summary, whether that already exists, \nor must be newly generated. Unless otherwise specified, the server has discretion to \nchoose how to fulfill the request. We anticipate that there will be a profusion of \nbusiness practices around currency/attestation, and therefore variance in parameters around that. \nIf some consistency emerges, HL7 would consider adding additional parameters to the base definition",
